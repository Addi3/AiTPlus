Unfortunately 0.2 will probably be the last update for AiT Plus (it might split into smaller projects like datapacks and stuff for ait but they wont add brand new content).
Other addon mods have show up since aitplus came out and ill admit that they are better than this mod (this is mainly cus they have an actual team behind them / support from ait devs). And it
seems like ait is adding stuff thats is already in this mod anyway.Now for a little behind the scenes info, i make aitplus with a piece of software called MCreator that is pretty decent if you want to learn modding basics, 
it doesnt offically support fabric meaning i have to use a (now discontinued) plug for 1.20.1 that allows it to work for fabric but it is also limiting what it can make (i dont like this factor). I might also just be straight up quiting 
modding for a while to focus on my Cosmic Odyssy datapack as it hasnt updated in months and im still re-making it. I plan to learn java properly eventually but i dont have time yet so dont expect any new / updates mods until then. If anyone wants to use assets from aitplus 
pls dm me on here and i will allow you to use them (with credit ofc).

My main focus will be on my vanilla datapack [HERE](https://github.com/Addi3/Cosmic-Odyssey)
